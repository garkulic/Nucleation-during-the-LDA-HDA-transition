# Nucleation during the LDA-HDA transition
The trajectory files of the isothermal (T = 77 K) processes of LDA compression and the reverse process of HDA decompression obtained as a result of molecular dynamics modelling in LAMMPS for the TIP4P/Ice model are available in this repository.

The compression rate is 1 GPa/ns. The size of the system is 2880 molecules.

You can also find the corresponding OVITO project with the nucleation detection algorithm.

These data supplement the paper "Molecular dynamics analysis of amorphous ice transformations: elastic properties and nucleation" (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1300246/v1)
