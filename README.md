# Nucleation during the LDA-HDA transition
The trajectory files of isothermal (T = 77 K) processes of LDA compression and reverse decompression of HDA obtained as a result of modelling for the TIP4P/Ice model are available in this repository. You can also find the OVITO project with the nucleation detection algorithm.

The compression rate is 1 GPa/ns.
The size of the system is 2880 molecules.
